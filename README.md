This is a beyond dirty CLI program to connect to KMP servers to chat. I'm not sure how exactly this would be useful, but anyway.

Because of my lazyness you will need to copy "KMPPlayerToken.txt" into the same directory as the program. If you're worried about this program stealing it, make a new guid first.
