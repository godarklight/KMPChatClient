This is a command line program to connect to KMP servers and chat. It's useful for linux users because of the unity typing bug.

This will connect to the server straight away:
mono KMPChatClient.exe username server_ip server_port

This will ask for info after starting:
mono KMPChatClient.exe

The program will automatically create a new GUID if it needs to.
